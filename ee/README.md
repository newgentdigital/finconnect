# Finconnect Enterprise Edition ("EE")

The `ee/` directory contains proprietary, commercially licensed features and enhancements for Finconnect, developed by Newgent Digital and its contributors. These components are designed for advanced use cases and are not available under open-source licenses.

> [!CAUTION]
> Code in this directory is governed by the terms in `ee/LICENSE` and is not covered by the AGPLv3 license used in the root directory.

## Why an "ee/" folder?

Finconnect Enterprise Edition provides cloud and enterprise-grade functionality tailored for Finconnect customers. It includes advanced features, integrations, and modules that require a valid commercial license from Newgent Digital when deployed on-premise.

## Comparison to other repository folders

- **Core folders (e.g., `api/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, `web/`)**: These contain the open-source foundation of Finconnect, available under AGPLv3 or other open licenses.
- **`ee/` folder**: Contains enterprise-only features. Usage requires a commercial license and is subject to additional restrictions.

## Licensing & usage

> [!WARNING]  
> The code in `ee/` is proprietary and protected. Unauthorized use, distribution, or hosting is not permitted.

You must obtain a valid license from Newgent Digital to use any code in the `ee/` directory in production.

Development and testing is permitted, but redistribution, public hosting, or commercial use without a license is strictly prohibited.
